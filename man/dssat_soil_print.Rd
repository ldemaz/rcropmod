\title{Creates a DSSAT .SOL (soil input) file}
\usage{
dssat_soil_print(
  soildt,
  filename,
  headstring = "SOIL file",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  tier4 = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{soildt}{A data.table containing, at a minimum, the critical variable
set (see details)}

\item{filename}{Output file name, including path (ideally to DSSATXX/SOIL). 
See details regarding naming convention.}

\item{headstring}{An optional description for the top of the file.}

\item{overwrite}{TRUE or FALSE (default) to overwrite existing file.}

\item{tier4}{TRUE or FALSE (default) to write fourth tier of soil parameters. 
These contain data that are usually not available.}
}
\description{
Creates a DSSAT .SOL (soil input) file
}
\details{
This function takes an entire soil input data.table and writes it 
out into a DSSAT .SOL soil input file. The input data.table must contain, 
at a minimum, the variables listed in \strong{ds_solcritvars}, named exactly 
as specified. These, and any other additional variables passed in through 
soildt should be named according to the \emph{dtnames} column in 
\strong{ds_solkey}. The corresponding DSSAT variable names are in the 
\emph{dssatnames} columns. In creating the file, note that DSSAT soil input 
files should have a name that matches the first two characters of the profile 
names within it, otherwise the model will not be able to find the soil 
profile. So if the profiles begin with AB, the soil file should be named 
AB.SOL. The soil profile name itself should be 10 characters long, beginning 
with the two character common prefix, following by additional characters and 
numbers, e.g. ABAA000001, AB00000001. The file should be written or 
transferred into the DSSATXX/SOIL directory. For large area applications, 
it might be preferable to create several soil files, perhaps one for each 
district, province or state.
